Either simply download the ZIP folder, or perform a git clone after navigating to your preferred directory, and executing 'git clone https://github.com/dedrituz/Face_Recognition_Python_sem4.git' using either your command prompt or git bash.

Before running the code, create a new empty subfolder 'Face_Recognition_Python_sem4/data'.

Run the code either from an IDE or execute 'python.exe -m main' in the command prompt while the current working directory is 'Face_Recognition_Python_sem4'
